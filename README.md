🚍 Automated Bus Scheduling

An AI-powered automated bus scheduling system designed to optimize driver assignments and streamline bus scheduling using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This system improves operational efficiency by automating scheduling and providing a dedicated admin portal for managing drivers, buses, and assignments. 📁 Project Structur /Automated-Bus-Scheduling-System

⚙️ Machine Learning Integration

This project incorporates Machine Learning-enhanced scheduling with optimization techniques to efficiently assign drivers to buses while maintaining constraints such as shift preferences, fatigue management, experience levels, and route difficulty. How It Works: ✅ Fetches available drivers & buses from MongoDB, filtering only those marked as available. ✅ Uses Machine Learning (Random Forest model) trained on historical scheduling data to generate a weighted cost matrix, prioritizing efficient driver-bus assignments. ✅ Constructs a Cost Matrix, dynamically adjusting penalties based on fatigue, shift mismatches, experience gaps, and regional constraints using ML predictions. ✅ Applies Hungarian Algorithm to determine the mathematically optimal assignments, ensuring balanced and efficient scheduling. ✅ Outputs optimized scheduling, storing results in MongoDB and reflecting them in the Admin Portal for seamless management.

Technologies Used: 🧠 Random Forest Classifier → Trained on past scheduling data to refine cost weight calculations, improving selection accuracy. 📊 Cost Matrix Optimization → Weights are dynamically adjusted using ML-generated predictions rather than static penalties. 🔢 Hungarian Algorithm (scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment) → Performs final optimization, ensuring best possible driver-bus pairing. 💾 MongoDB Storage → Retains historical schedules to continuously refine future assignment strategies.

Why ML + Optimization Is Used: ✔ Ensures mathematically optimal assignments → Hungarian Algorithm guarantees best matches for drivers and buses. ✔ Incorporates adaptive learning → ML refines penalty weights for fatigue, shift mismatches, and difficulty levels over time. ✔ Balances automation with real-world constraints → Prevents driver fatigue, prioritizes shift preferences, and assigns experienced drivers to complex routes.
